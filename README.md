# HydraComms - Decentralized Forum Software WIP

This project currently contains a prototype of HydraComms. The main idea behind this forum software is that each user has a copy of the entire forum on his/her computer. This prevents admin abuse as users can very easily "fork" the forum. An entire forum can also be shared as simply as sending a text file. Authentication is achieved using public key cryptography, this prevents any impersonations.

# TODO:

- Rewrite in a faster language than python

- Create an attractive GUI

- Possibly features such as searching or tags or similar
